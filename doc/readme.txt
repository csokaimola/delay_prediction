The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled and diverted flights appears in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report, published about 30 days after the month's end, as well as in summary tables posted on this website. BTS began collecting details on the causes of flight delays in June 2003. Summary statistics and raw data are made available to the public at the time the Air Travel Consumer Report is released.
This dataset only contains flight operated by Alaska Airlines.

1. Please create a Regression model that is able to predict the delay for every flight. We erased the factual data for the second half of 2018, this is what you should predict with the model.
2. You can use any additional variables you can publicly find.
3. The code has to be clean, readable and written either in Python or R.
4. Solutions will be compared via RMSE and R2, business acumen, creativity and coding skills.
5. You can find a submission_sample file in the folder, please use that format when creating your predictions.
